  <h1>Changes</h1>
  <h2>Banners</h2>
  <p><b>Subject: </b>Balancing the Sides</p>
  <p><b>Guideline: </b><a href="http://www.webstyleguide.com/wsg3/3-information-architecture/4-presenting-information.html">Presenting Information</a></p>
  <p><b>Rational: </b>The first change that I made was that I added another banner <br> 
    to the right side of the webpage to make it seem balanced. Then I had to center <br> 
    the content in between the two banners. Because the site is more balanced, it <br> 
    makes it easier to read and it is more comfortable than just looking at one side<br> 
    of the page. I left the content on the showtimes page to the left because I <br> 
    wanted to follow the "golden triangle."</p>
  <h2>Footer</h2>
  <p><b>Subject: </b>Adding a Footer</p>
  <p><b>Guideline: </b><a href="http://www.webstyleguide.com/wsg3//7-page-design/2-document-design.html">Document Design</a></p>
  <p><b>Rational: </b>I added a footer to the bottom of the page that will stay <br>
    with you as you scroll. The addition of this footer makes the site feel more <br>
    complete now that it has some sort of information. Along with the contact <br>
    information, I added two pictures to both side to make the footer feel more <br>
    apart of the page instead of it just being there.</p>
